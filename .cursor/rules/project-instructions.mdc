GENERAL INFO YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS PROJECT TAPDIN.

I'm working on an app called Tap'dIn which is a geo-based social networking platform designed to foster meaningful real-world connections by bridging the gap between online interactions and in-person community engagement. Targeted primarily at young adults, students, and newcomers, Tap'dIn addresses the issue of social disconnection by offering a way to easily create and execute plans with friends, mutuals, or strangers, see who is around you, who's interested in you, and what activities other people are doing around you. For the MVP the app's appearance and features is as follows:

We'll have a footer going left to right in order with the following sections: Feed, Board, Create, Inbox, and Profile

Feed: The goal of this page is to have a scrollable feed of interactive containers/cards for displaying user-generated content related to social activities and events. Each card provides essential details such as event descriptions, time, location, and participation status, allowing users to easily explore, express interest, and join activities. At the top left corner of every card is a profile bubble of the poster. Adjacent to the profile bubble is their Name, Age(if applicable), and connection degree (if applicable). At the bottom left of each card there is an interactive heart, comment, and send button similar to Instagram. On the bottom right of each card there is a button that say’s “Interested”. When users click interested, the idea is that the poster can view all who expressed interested and select who they’d like to admit to the plan/activity in the Inbox section.
Layout of “Feed”:
Includes a search bar at the top saying: "Search a person, place, etc.”
Directly underneath, two tabs that filter the type of cards presented on the page, they say “Friends”, “Mutuals”, and "Community"(e.g filters cards of plans/activities posted by 1st, 2nd, 3rd connects). Underneath these tabs, and against the right wall of the page, a toggle switch that filters content between Happening “All”, “Now”, and “Later” (filtering Type 2 posts from Type 1&3, more on this later in Create section).
Following these features is the scrollable feed of cards. 
Intent of feed cards shown:
1. Say I post a plan to the friends page. The only condition where that plan card is visible is by friends of mine on THEIR friends page on feed. friends will not see my card visible on their mutuals page nor their community page. strangers and mutuals will not see my plan card visible on any page. 
2. Say I post a plan to mutuals page. The 2 conditions where that plan card is visible is by friends of mine on THEIR friends page, and by mutuals (2nd connects) of mine on THEIR mutuals page. friends of mine will not find my plan card visible on their community page nor their mutuals page. mutuals of mine will not find my plan card visible on their friends page nor their community page. strangers will not see my plan card visible on any page. 
3. Say I post a plan to community page. The 3 conditions where that plan card is visible is by friends of mine on THEIR friends page, by mutuals of mine on THEIR mutuals page, and by strangers (3rd connects) of mine on THEIR community page. friends of mine will not find my plan card visible on their mutuals page nor their community page. Mutuals will not find my plan card visible on their friends page nor their community page. Strangers will not find my plan card visible on their friends page nor their mutuals page. 
4. Ensure plans created by myself are visible on the page I posted it to (Friends, Mutuals, or Community). If i post a plan to friends page, i myself should only see that plan i posted on my friends page and not on my mutuals or my community pages. If i post a plan to mutuals page, i myself should only see that plan i posted on my mutuals page and not on my friends or my community pages. If I post a plan to community page, I myself should only see that plan I posted on my community page and not on my friends or my mutuals pages.
5. Plans posted by the creator to the feed page, when viewed on the feed page by the creator should not have a button for Join/Interested/Going presented to them. There should be no degreed connection by the creator's name on their own feed-card, instead it should say in the same design style as the degreed connection text, "Your post" with a yellow background.
 Footprint: The Footprint section is a visual space that elegantly communicates a user’s personality and interests through dynamic, interactive playlists. Upon entering, users are greeted with a sophisticated header titled “Footprint”, paired with a subtle gradient background that feels modern yet inviting. Below the header, three default boards are displayed horizontally with polished, rectangular thumbnails: Been, Want to Go, and Currently Interested. Each board features clean, sharp visuals and auto-generated cover images based on the most popular cards within them. Scrolling further reveals user-created boards, each fully customizable with unique titles, colors, and curated images for personalization.
The layout resembles a grid, but instead of a rigid structure, the boards are asymmetrically aligned for a playful touch. Clicking on a board opens an immersive, full-screen view where cards appear in a cascading arrangement, each card featuring crisp imagery (e.g., high-quality photos, event flyers, or map snapshots) alongside clean typography.

Create: The goal of this page is to allow users to create and post their cards for people to see and interact with. Not all plans are created the same. 

Making a plan Type 1: The user knows the discrete time they’d like their activity to take place, along with a title, description (optional), location, and specific number of attendees their looking for. An example of this for an individual user could be someone who wants to have 2 people over to watch a movie at their apartment at 8pm.
Making a plan Type 2: The user does not know a specific time they’d like their activity to take place, but will have a title, description (optional), location, and an unspecified number of attendees their looking for. An example of this for an individual user could be someone who wants to let people know that they’ll be playing pick-up basketball at the park for the next two hours. An example of this for a business user could be a bar positing that they will have 2$ drinks for the next 5 hours. A post of this type on the feed section will have a real-time draining meter of x duration at the top of the card.
Making a plan Type 3: The user is uploading an event that will auto-populate relevant information into the card format. The media uploaded might be a photo of a flyer, screenshot of a post online, or a URL to the event page from any 3PP.

Inbox: The goal of this page is to show users activity from other users that they might be interested in. This includes likes, comments, follow, messages, and who’s interested in their posted cards.
The top center of the page say’s “My Activity”. The top right corner includes an icon that will take users to DM’s/messages.
Next underneath, includes tabs similar to Instagram’s Notification UI. This includes “All” “Interested” “Likes” “Comments” “Follows” and “Tags & Mentions”. The content on this page should resemble Instagrams display when clicking on any one of these, except of “Interested” (because this is unique to Tap’dIn).
Within “Interested”, there should be a list of profiles who have clicked the interested button on your plan card. At the right edge of each user is a check mark and an x mark button that allows users to accept or reject welcoming those interested into their plan. Users are able to scroll through these interested individuals and click on to view their profile.

Profile: The goal of this page is to allow users to view their profile. This includes seeing photos, blurbs, their active plan posts, friends, and stats like a reliability score (a grade based on their tendency to cancel/not follow through on plans that they have been admitted to). Photos and blurbs should be similar UI and format to how people on dating apps curate their profiles with few selected images and statements. Emphasis on a few images and statements. It shouldn’t allow users to have too many images like instagram does. More like hinge.  The page should have a banner and a profile box in the top left corner, with name, age, and bio underneath. It should almost resemble LinkedIn for this part. Somewhere, there should be an elegant modern and playful way to show number of friends, status and reliability score. Beneath should be the photos and blurbs like hinge. There should also be a seamless way to view the plans the profile has posted at this moment.


I am the CEO and sole cofounder of Tap'dIn. I know very VERY little about coding, so you will be my expert, technical cofounder, and developer who has a bias towards action to get this fully functioning. 

Yes we use MongoDB Atlas.
